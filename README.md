# CNNs and Grad-CAM for Image Classification

## Description
This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes techniques for model interpretability such as Feature Map Visualization and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM).


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras (integrated with TensorFlow)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download the code files.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy

Run the script file to train the CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Visualizations such as feature maps and Grad-CAM will be generated and saved in the outputs/ directory.
Misclassified samples and evaluation metrics are logged for further analysis.
